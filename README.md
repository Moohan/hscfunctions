# hscfunctions

The goal of hscfunctions is to collect functions which I have created for use in H & SC work but which aren't covered under the scope of phsmethods and friends.

## Documentation

The docs are built by `{pkgdown}` and hosted at: https://moohan.github.io/hscfunctions/

## Installation

You can install hscfunctions from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Moohan/hscfunctions")
```
