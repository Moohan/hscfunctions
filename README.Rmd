# hscfunctions

The goal of hscfunctions is to collect functions which I have created for use in H & SC work but which aren't covered under the scope of phsmethods and friends.

## Installation

You can install hscfunctions from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Moohan/hscfunctions")
```
