# hscfunctions

The goal of hscfunctions is to collect functions which I have created
for use in my Health and Social Care work at Public Health Scotland
(PHS) but which arenâ€™t covered under the scope of `{phsmethods}` and
friends.

## Documentation

The docs are built by `{pkgdown}` and hosted at:
<https://moohan.github.io/hscfunctions/>

## Installation

You can install hscfunctions from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Moohan/hscfunctions")
```
